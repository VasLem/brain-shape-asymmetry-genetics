# Global-To-Local Segmentation and Genotypic Analysis Of Brain Shape Asymmetry

Overall purpose of this thesis is to complement the existing bibliography on the detection and examination of
the genetic associations of brain shape asymmetry. Asymmetry components (Directional,Individual and
Fluctuating) will be computed based on the brain MRI dataset provided by UK Biobank database. A data-
driven approach will be followed, where the brain surface will be partitioned in an unsupervised way,
through Hierarchical Spectral Clustering, a technique that will allow for a coarse to fine segmentation.
Aggregated asymmetry measurements will be retrieved from the segments, whose genetic correlation will be
examined through a multivariate genome-association scan (mvGWAS) statistical analysis. Recognized
significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will then be analyzed individually or in groups,
through comparison with existing results and databases. The genetic overlap with neurodevelopmental
disorders and traits, that have been reported to exhibit phenotypic associations with brain structure, such as
Autism, Alzheimerâ€™s Disease or intelligence, will be examined. Functional annotations of variants associated
with the genes where the significant SNPs were detected will be constructed, offering an insight into the
functional reasoning behind the brain shape asymmetry existence.
