Heritability of phenotype 1
---------------------------
Total Observed scale h2: 0.0153 (0.0123)
Lambda GC: 1.0135
Mean Chi^2: 1.0103
Intercept: 0.9997 (0.0059)
Ratio < 0 (usually indicates GC correction).

Heritability of phenotype 2/2
-----------------------------
Total Observed scale h2: 0.0026 (0.0109)
Lambda GC: 1.0135
Mean Chi^2: 1.0125
Intercept: 1.0107 (0.0056)
Ratio: 0.8583 (0.4511)

Genetic Covariance
------------------
Total Observed scale gencov: 0.0136 (0.0071)
Mean z1*z2: 0.3095
Intercept: 0.2999 (0.0037)

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds) 
Z-score: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
P: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
WARNING: rg was out of bounds.
This often means that h2 is not significantly different from zero.
