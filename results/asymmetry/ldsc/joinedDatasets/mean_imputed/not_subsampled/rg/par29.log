-----------------------------
Total Observed scale h2: 0.0153 (0.0123)
Lambda GC: 1.0135
Mean Chi^2: 1.0103
Intercept: 0.9997 (0.0059)
Ratio < 0 (usually indicates GC correction).

Computing rg for phenotype 3/3
Reading summary statistics from ../results/asymmetry/ldsc/joinedDatasets/mean_imputed/not_subsampled/munged/par31.sumstats.gz ...
Read summary statistics for 1217311 SNPs.
After merging with summary statistics, 1168875 SNPs remain.
1168875 SNPs with valid alleles.

Heritability of phenotype 3/3
-----------------------------
Total Observed scale h2: 0.0026 (0.0109)
Lambda GC: 1.0135
Mean Chi^2: 1.0125
Intercept: 1.0107 (0.0056)
Ratio: 0.8583 (0.4511)

Genetic Covariance
------------------
Total Observed scale gencov: 0.0209 (0.0064)
Mean z1*z2: 0.21
Intercept: 0.1953 (0.0036)

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds) 
Z-score: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
P: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
WARNING: rg was out of bounds.
This often means that h2 is not significantly different from zero.
