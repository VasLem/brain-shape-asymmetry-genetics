Computing rg for phenotype 2/2
Reading summary statistics from ../results/asymmetry/ldsc/BATCH2_2021_DATA/mean_imputed/not_subsampled/munged/par30.sumstats.gz ...

After merging with summary statistics, 1174407 SNPs remain.
1168875 SNPs with valid alleles.

Heritability of phenotype 1
---------------------------
Total Observed scale h2: 0.0184 (0.0225)
Lambda GC: 1.0046
Mean Chi^2: 1.0045
Intercept: 0.9975 (0.0061)
Ratio < 0 (usually indicates GC correction).

Heritability of phenotype 2/2
-----------------------------
Total Observed scale h2: 0.0071 (0.0273)
Lambda GC: 1.0135
Mean Chi^2: 1.0058
Intercept: 1.0036 (0.0061)
Ratio: 0.6175 (1.0471)

Genetic Covariance
------------------
Total Observed scale gencov: 0.0185 (0.012)
Mean z1*z2: 0.1793
Intercept: 0.1728 (0.0034)

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds) 
Z-score: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
P: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
WARNING: rg was out of bounds.
This often means that h2 is not significantly different from zero.
