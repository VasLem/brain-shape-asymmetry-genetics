Interpreting column names as follows:
P-value:	p-Value
N:	Sample size
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
rsID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
ChiScore:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ../SAMPLE_DATA/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from data.csv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8304016 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 7127561 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 247 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1176208 SNPs remain.
Removed 242 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1175966 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 1000.0 (1175966 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 0.990361423937, which seems sensible.
Removed 122 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1175844 SNPs remain).
