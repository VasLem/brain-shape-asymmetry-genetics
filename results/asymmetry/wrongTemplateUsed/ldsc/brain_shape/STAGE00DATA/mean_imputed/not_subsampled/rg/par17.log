Total Observed scale gencov: 12.0153 (4.5426)
Mean z1*z2: 36.1161
Intercept: 26.9648 (2.7637)

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds) 
Z-score: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
P: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
WARNING: rg was out of bounds.
This often means that h2 is not significantly different from zero.
