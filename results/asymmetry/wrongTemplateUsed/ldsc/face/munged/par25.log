Interpreting column names as follows:
P-value:	p-Value
N:	Sample size
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
rsID:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
ChiScore:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.

Reading sumstats from data.csv into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
WARNING: 16655 SNPs had P outside of (0,1]. The P column may be mislabeled.
Read 23709 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 16655 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 1484 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
5570 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (5570 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 1000.0 (5570 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 1.0, which seems sensible.
