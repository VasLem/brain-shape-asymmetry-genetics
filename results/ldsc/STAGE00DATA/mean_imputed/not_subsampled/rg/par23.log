Total Observed scale h2: 192.4694 (222.6075)
Lambda GC: 1823.7689
Mean Chi^2: 1100.1692
Intercept: 1037.3745 (62.9951)
Ratio: 0.9429 (0.0573)

Genetic Covariance
------------------
Total Observed scale gencov: 3.2331 (3.3011)
Mean z1*z2: -12.5901
Intercept: -14.2399 (1.5312)

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds) 
Z-score: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds)
P: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds)
WARNING: One of the h2's was out of bounds.
This usually indicates a data-munging error or that h2 or N is low.
