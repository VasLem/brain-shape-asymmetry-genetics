Genetic Covariance
------------------
Total Observed scale gencov: -1.2793 (2.4504)
Mean z1*z2: 25.9847

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds) 
Z-score: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds)
P: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds)
WARNING: One of the h2's was out of bounds.
This usually indicates a data-munging error or that h2 or N is low.
