Genetic Covariance
------------------
Total Observed scale gencov: 2.1962 (3.4341)
Mean z1*z2: 26.2552
Intercept: 24.5394 (2.6495)

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds) 
Z-score: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds)
P: nan (nan) (h2  out of bounds)
WARNING: One of the h2's was out of bounds.
This usually indicates a data-munging error or that h2 or N is low.
