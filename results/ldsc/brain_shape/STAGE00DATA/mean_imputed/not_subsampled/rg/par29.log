Computing rg for phenotype 285/286
Reading summary statistics from ../results/ldsc/brain_shape/munged/par284.sumstats.gz ...
Read summary statistics for 54609 SNPs.
After merging with summary statistics, 8559 SNPs remain.
8559 SNPs with valid alleles.
WARNING: number of SNPs less than 200k; this is almost always bad.

Heritability of phenotype 285/286

Genetic Correlation
-------------------
Genetic Correlation: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)

P: nan (nan) (rg out of bounds)
WARNING: rg was out of bounds.
This often means that h2 is not significantly different from zero.
