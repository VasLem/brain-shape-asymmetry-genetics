\section{General}
A large dataset of 19,654 individuals was used as the main, discovery dataset, while a smaller one, coming from a different batch, of 16,342 individuals was used as a replication dataset during \ac{gwas}.

\section{\Ac{mri} Shapes Normalization}\label{subsec:shape_normalization}
The current work applies principles from general symmetry studies to model cortical asymmetry. For any of these analyses to occur, the preprocessing of \ac{3d} shapes produced from \ac{mri} scans needs to be considered. \Ac{mri} output is affected by the subject positioning and technical error \cite{Wittens2021}.  Volumetric differences also increase the level of discrepancies among \ac{mri} samples.  To prevent positioning and volume deviations from gravely affecting shape comparisons, a normalization is required\cite{Klingenberg2020}. The samples are represented as a set of landmarks $\mathcal{G}$ of predefined dimensionality, joined together with predefined edges $\mathcal{V}$, forming a multiple-connected structure $S$, that is a graph in which there is at least one path joining any two vertices. The normalization is performed through the application of \ac{gpa}. \Ac{gpa} is an algorithm that iteratively performs translation, scaling and rotation on a given set of structures $S$, given a reference $S_0$, aiming to minimize the euclidean distance of corresponding points. The transformed samples then belong to what it has been coined as Kendall Space \cite{Klingenberg2020}. Under the framework of symmetry analysis, a single hemisphere is considered to be one of the $S$ structures. To apply any symmetry analysis, therefore, one of the individual hemispheres needs to be mirrored on the other side of the midsagittal plane, and then \ac{gpa} is applied to align all hemispheres at once.

\section{Symmetry Statistical analysis}
Bilateral asymmetry is mainly described using three components in literature \cite{klingenberg2002}\cite{Vingerhoets2021}. \Acf{da}, the main focus of this study, corresponds to the hemispheric side effect, namely how the intrinsic (i.e. genetic) properties of the studied population are manifesting across individuals. Antisymmetry, which is related to the effect where sidedness is random in a population (i.e. left-right pattern is mirrored to a right-left pattern), is not observed in the human cerebral cortex, in contrast to other internal organs positions, or organisms \cite{Neubauer2020}. The third component, \acf{fa}, encompasses any random developmental and environmental effects, that cannot be explained with the existing knowledge. The observed deviations can be statistically linearly modeled as products of two effects, the hemisphere side studied and the individual specimen analyzed, as well as their interaction \cite{klingenberg2002}. Formally, based on \cite{VanDongen1999} assuming the presence of replications for each observation per individual, to account for technical error, a mixed linear model representing the aforementioned dependencies is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	Y_{ijk} = \mu + \beta + I_i + S_{ij} + E_{ijk}
\end{equation}
where $Y_{ijk}$ is the phenotype of the i-th individual, from the j-th side, under the k-th replication, $\mu$ and $\beta$ are the fixed intercept and fixed side effect respectively, $I_i\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{ind})$ is the random individual effect,  $S_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{FA})$ is the random side and individual specific effect, matched to \ac{fa}, and $E_{ijk}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{ME})$ is the measurement error. Replications are necessary in such analyses, in order to distinguish \ac{fa} effect from measurement error. Given this definition, a way to measure the statistical significance is performed through an F-test applied on 2-way \ac{anova}, to relate the \ac{rss} ratios of effects to observable error terms, and of fluctuating effect to the measurement error. Extra care needs to be given on the determination of the \ac{dof} of each term, given the preprocessing applied to bring the hemispheres surfaces into Kendall shape space \cite{klingenberg2002}. Given that the analysis is performed on a pair of symmetric objects, and not on a single symmetric object, this configuration is named \textbf{matching asymmetry analysis}.
