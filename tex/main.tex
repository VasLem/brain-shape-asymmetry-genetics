\begin{abstract}
	Overall purpose of this thesis is to complement the existing bibliography on the detection and examination of the genetic associations of brain shape asymmetry. Asymmetry components  are computed based on the  brain \ac{mri} dataset provided by UK Biobank database. A data-driven approach is followed, where the brain surface is partitioned in an unsupervised manner, through  \ac{hsc}, a technique that allows for  a coarse-to-fine segmentation. Aggregated asymmetry measurements are retrieved from the segments, whose genetic correlation is examined through a \ac{mvgwas} statistical analysis. Recognized significant \acp{snp} are then analyzed individually or in groups, through comparison with existing results and databases.  The genetic overlap with neurodevelopmental disorders and traits, that have been reported to exhibit phenotypic associations with brain structure asymmetry, such as Autism, Alzheimerâ€™s Disease or intelligence, are examined. Functional annotations of variants associated with the genes where significant \acp{snp} were detected are constructed, offering an insight into the functional reasoning behind the brain shape asymmetry existence. Further comparisons with other past human phenotypic characteristics studies are lastly applied.
