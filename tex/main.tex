	I would like to convey my deep gratitude to everyone that  supported me throughout the writing of this thesis. Specifically, professor Peter Claes provided the grounds for its conception and a concrete plan for its manifestation, offering me access to the essential tools, data and advice. Professor Isabelle Cleynen supplied me with the necessary threoretical basis on population genetics, without which I would not be capable or feel confident enough to confront the thesis' complexity. My mentors, PhD students Meng Yuan and Seppe Goovaerts, offered extremely valuable feedback through frequent communication and to-the-point advice at every step of the project, successfully guiding me towards its realization. Last but not least, I owe a great thank you to the people that stood beside me, family and friends, whose tolerance and support comprised the cornerstone of this effort.

\begin{abstract}
	The overall purpose of this thesis has been to complement the existing bibliography on the detection and examination of the genetic associations of brain shape asymmetry. Asymmetry components  are computed based on the  brain \ac{mri} dataset provided by UK Biobank database. A data-driven approach is followed, where the brain surface is partitioned in an unsupervised manner, through  \ac{hsc}, a technique that allows for  a coarse-to-fine segmentation. Aggregated asymmetry measurements are retrieved from the segments, whose genetic association is examined through a \ac{mvgwas} statistical analysis. Recognized significant \acp{snp} were then analyzed individually or in groups, through comparison with existing results and databases.  The genetic overlap with neurodevelopmental disorders and traits, that have been reported to exhibit phenotypic associations with brain structure asymmetry, such as autism, Alzheimerâ€™s disease or intelligence, were examined. Functional annotations of variants associated with the genes where significant \acp{snp} were detected were obtained, offering an insight into the functional reasoning behind the brain shape asymmetry existence.
