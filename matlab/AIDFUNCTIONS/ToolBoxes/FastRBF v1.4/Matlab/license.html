      <li><p><strong>Licence File:</strong> You must only use the
      Software with an electronic licence file provided to you by FFT
      (Licence File) that operates the Software either as an
      evaluation version (<strong>Evaluation Version</strong>) or as a
      fully registered version (<strong>Registered
      Version</strong>). If the Software is an Evaluation Version, you
      may evaluate the Software for a maximum of 30 days. The
      Evaluation Version may contain limitations to the functionality
      of the Software that do not exist in the Registered Version. If
      you wish to continue using the Evaluation Version beyond the 30
      day evaluation period you must purchase a Licence File for the
      Registered Version through FFT's website at <a
      href="http://www.farfieldtechnology.com/">www.farfieldtechnology.com</a>
      or by emailing FFT at <a
      href="mailto:sales@farfieldtechnology.com">sales@farfieldtechnology.com</a>.
      The Registered Version may contain limitations to the
      functionality of the Software depending on the type of Licence
      File you purchase.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Licence:</strong> FFT grants you a non-exclusive,

      this Agreement. "<strong>Use</strong>" of the Software means
      loading, installing, or running the Software together with a
      valid Licence File on a computer. Regardless of the number or
      type of media by which the Software is provided to you (such as
      Software delivered to you on CD-ROM and/or downloaded by you off
      the Internet), you must only install one copy of the Software on
      one computer and be the only individual using the Software. If
      you are a corporation, FFT grants you the right to have
      individuals within your organisation use the Software provided
      that the Software is used only by one individual at any one time
      and in the manner specified above. You may install the Software
      on an internal multi-user platform or network provided that you
      purchase a Licence File for each separate computer on which the
      Software is installed or accessible from the network.</p></li>

      <li><p><strong>Restrictions on Use:</strong> You must not:</p>

          any person for reward, unless you pay to FFT the difference 
          between FFT's standard licence fee and the amount you originally 
          paid.</p></li>

      reason and FFT becomes liable for loss or damage that would
      otherwise have been excluded, such liability will be limited to
      the total amount actually paid by you for the Software.</p></li>
