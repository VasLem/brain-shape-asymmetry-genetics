function parents = selectionroulette(obj)
%SELECTIONROULETTE Choose parents using roulette wheel.
%   PARENTS = SELECTIONROULETTE(EXPECTATION,NPARENTS,OPTIONS) chooses
%   PARENTS using EXPECTATION and number of parents NPARENTS. On each 
%   of the NPARENTS trials, every parent has a probability of being selected
%   that is proportional to their expectation.
%
%   Example:
%   Create an options structure using SELECTIONROULETTE as the selection
%   function
%     options = gaoptimset('SelectionFcn',@selectionroulette);
