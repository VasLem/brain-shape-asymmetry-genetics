function parents = selectionuniform(obj)
%SELECTIONUNIFORM Choose parents at random.
%   PARENTS = SELECTIONUNIFORM(EXPECTATION,NPARENTS,OPTIONS) chooses
%   PARENTS randomly using the EXPECTATION and number of parents NPARENTS. 
%
%   Parent selection is NOT a function of performance. This selection function 
%   is useful for debugging your own custom selection, or for comparison. It is 
%   not useful for actual evolution of high performing individuals. 
%
%   Example:
%   Create an options structure using SELECTIONUNIFORM as the selection
%   function.
%     options = gaoptimset('SelectionFcn', @selectionuniform);
