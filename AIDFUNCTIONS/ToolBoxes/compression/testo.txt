Image Compression 

A collection of simple routines for image compression using different techniques.

BTCODE:
Image compression Using Block Truncation Coding.

PYRAMID:
Image compression based on Gaussian Pyramids.

DCTCOMPR:
Image compression based on Discrete Cosine Transform.

IMCOMPR:
Image compression based on Singular Value Decomposition.


The given codes can be also used in 2D noise suppression.



Notes:
       The function "conv2fft" performs a 2D FFT-based convolution.
       Type "help conv2fft" on Matlab command window for more informations.
