Interpreting column names as follows:
N:	Sample size
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
SIGN:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from ldsc/w_hm3.noMHC.snplist
Read 1215001 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from MUNGE_INPUT2.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 1136925 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 23 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1136902 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1136902 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 4155.0 (1136902 SNPs remain).
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 1.0, which seems sensible.
Removed 6 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1136896 SNPs remain).
