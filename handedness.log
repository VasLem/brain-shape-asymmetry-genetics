Interpreting column names as follows:
info:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
a_1:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
a_0:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
rsid:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
left_t:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
pvalue:	p-Value

Reading sumstats from SAMPLE_DATA/GWASCatalog/Handedness/DeKovel_PMID30980028_left_pval_maf001.assoc into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 15053982 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 105377 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 3511927 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
11436678 SNPs remain.
Removed 6018 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (11430660 SNPs remain).
Using N = 331037.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was -0.0024449, which seems sensible.
Writing summary statistics for 11430660 SNPs (11430660 with nonmissing beta) to handedness.sumstats.gz.
